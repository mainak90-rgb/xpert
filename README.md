# xpert

A programming language written in python. I'm
still working in this project. It is a interpreted 
langiage for now but leter I want to change this to
a compiled language.


## Installation

Install 'xpert' programming language by run 

```bash
  python shell.py
```
    
## Requirments

To install this project the system should have
pre-installed --

`python`



## Documentation

This is just the beginning of the project.
I only add arithmetic operation for now.

Run the shell.py file; 

it will open a command prompt editor like python, every code will be written in here.

```
$$ 1+2
```
output - 3

It has addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo and power operation for now.

>>Division always return floating point value

>>All other operation return float if one of the operand is float; otherwise return int.

For now it only support int(Integer) and float(Floating point number).
